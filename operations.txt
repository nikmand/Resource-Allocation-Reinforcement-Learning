### In this file we include instructions about the operations needed during this project.

### System operations

# export pqos in server, otherwise it can be set permanently to ~/.bashrc(DONE).
export LD_LIBRARY_PATH=/home/users/nmandil/intel-cmt-cat/lib/

# information about the cache (size of ways etc) and about the capabilities of pqos
~/intel-cmt-cat/pqos/pqos -D

# reset COS and associations
./pqos -R

# check current pqos settings
./pqos -s

# command to get the hyperthreaded pair of cpu10, the second core number is a hyperthread
cat /sys/devices/system/cpu/cpu10/topology/thread_siblings_list

### Project operations

# launch the Memcached Server on core 0 with 16GB of memory
numactl -m 0 -N 0 -C 0 ~/memcached-server/memcached -l 127.0.0.1:11211 -t 1 -m 16384 -n 550 &

# warm up the server by running the loader (as indicated by cloudsuite)
~/memcached/loader -a ~/memcached/twitter_dataset/twitter_dataset_30x -s ~/memcached/docker_servers.txt -w 4 -S 1 -D 16384 -j -T 1000 -Z

# launch tensorboard (locally)
tensorboard --logdir runs

# launch tensorboard on 2nd server socket
#taskset --cpu-list 15 tensorboard --logdir ~/path/to/runs &

# to see Tensorboard locally ssh with port forwarding from server
ssh -L 16006:127.0.0.1:6006 username@broady3.cslab.ece.ntua.gr

# to run the agent
time taskset --cpu-list 18-19 python main_agent.py args

# to run the measurements main
time taskset --cpu-list 18-19 python main_measurements.py args --ways-be $way

# to update rlsuite library
pip install git+https://github.com/nikmand/Reinforcement-Learning-Library.git#egg=rlsuite -U
